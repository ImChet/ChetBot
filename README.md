# Creating your own Discord Bot

If you wish to create your own Discord Bot, it needs to work with the Discord API. This section explains how to utilize the discord.py library to work with Discord's API.

### Making a Discord Bot account

##### Steps:
* Navigate to: `https://discord.com/developers/applications`
* Click on the "New Application"
* Give your application a name and click "Create"
* Next, create a Bot User by navigating to the tab labeled "Bot", and clicking "Add Bot"
  * Click "Yes, do it" to continue
* If you want your Bot to be able ot join other people's servers, you must ensure that the option "Public Bot" is checked
  * Also, make sure that the option "Require OAuth2 Code Grant" is unchecked unless you are working with or developing a service that needs it.
* Generate your Bot's API Key and copy it

Now that you have that API Key, you can use your program to login to Discord with your new Bot account.

### Inviting your Discord Bot account

So you made your new Bot, but it is not in any server yet. Here are the steps to invite it to any server of your choosing (Assuming you have permission to invite users).

Firstly, you must create an invite URL for your bot.
##### Steps:
* Navigate to: `https://discord.com/developers/applications`
* Click on your Bot's page
* Go to the "OAuth2" tab on the left-hand side
  * Then navigate to the sub-option "OAuth2 URL Generator"
* Tick the "bot" scope checkbox
  * A new list of checkbox options should appear under the scopes section called "Bot Permissions"
* Under this new section, check the boxes matching the permissions that your bot will require when it joins a server to function as intended
  * Make sure that you are aware of the consequences of requiring your bot to have the “Administrator” permission
* The resulting URL that is generated at the bottom of the screen can be copied when all of the required permissions for your Bot have been checked
* Paste the URL into your web browser and choose which server you would like to have your Bot join, and click "Authorize"

Your Bot should now have successfully joined the Discord Server of your choosing.

### Working with your Discord Bot

Now that you have generated your Discord Bot's API Key and you have invited it to the server(s) of your choosing, you probably want to get to work making your Bot function as you wish.

To do this, make sure that you have cloned the ChetBot files from my GitHub.
##### Steps:
* Follow the instructions on the [GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository) if you are unfamiliar with cloning repositories
  * ChetBot repository Link: `https://github.com/ImChet/ChetBot.git`
* In the newly cloned ChetBot repository, find the apikeys.py file, navigate to the discordBotAPIKey string definition and place your Discord Bot API Key in it.

You are now ready to use your Discord Bot. 

To do this, run the main.py file to sign onto Discord as your Bot.

You may use the built-in ChetBot commands and event listeners as examples for your own Bot. If you wish, you can start from scratch and figure your own way around the discord.py library or view their [documentation](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html) as reference.
